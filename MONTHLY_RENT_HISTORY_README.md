# Monthly Rent History Feature

## Overview

The PropertyFlow application now includes a comprehensive monthly rent history tracking system that allows you to manage rent payments for each unit on a month-by-month basis. This feature provides a structured way to track rent collection, payment methods, and maintain historical records.

## Features

### Monthly Rent History Structure
Each unit now has a monthly rent history that includes:
- **Month**: January through December (1-12)
- **Year**: Calendar year for the rent period
- **Rent Date**: The actual date when rent was received
- **Amount**: The rent amount collected
- **Method**: Payment method used (Bank Transfer, Check, Cash, etc.)
- **Notes**: Optional notes about the payment

### Key Benefits
1. **12-Month Grid View**: Visual representation of all months in a year
2. **Payment Tracking**: Track when and how rent was collected
3. **Historical Records**: Maintain complete payment history
4. **CSV Import/Export**: Bulk import rent history data
5. **Year Navigation**: Switch between different years
6. **Payment Status**: Clear indicators for paid vs unpaid months

## Database Schema

### New Table: `monthly_rent_history`
```sql
CREATE TABLE monthly_rent_history (
    id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
    unit_id UUID REFERENCES units(id) ON DELETE CASCADE NOT NULL,
    year INTEGER NOT NULL,
    month INTEGER NOT NULL CHECK (month >= 1 AND month <= 12),
    rent_date DATE,
    amount DECIMAL(10,2),
    method TEXT,
    notes TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW() NOT NULL,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW() NOT NULL,
    UNIQUE(unit_id, year, month)
);
```

### Key Constraints
- One record per unit per month per year (UNIQUE constraint)
- Month must be between 1-12
- Cascading delete when unit is removed

## Migration from Legacy Data

If you have existing rent history data in the old `rent_history` table, you can migrate it using the SQL script provided in `update_rent_history_schema.sql`. Uncomment the migration section to automatically convert existing data to the new format.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **"No units found" message**: Make sure the property has units assigned
2. **Year not showing**: Check that the year is within the last 5 years
3. **Save not working**: Verify all required fields are filled
4. **CSV import errors**: Check column names and data formats

### Performance Considerations
- Large datasets are paginated
- Year filtering reduces data load
- Indexes are created for optimal query performance

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:
1. Bulk operations (add/edit multiple months)
2. Rent payment reminders
3. Late payment tracking
4. Payment method analytics
5. Export to accounting software
6. Automated rent collection tracking

## Support

For issues or questions about the monthly rent history feature:
1. Check the console for error messages
2. Verify database schema is properly updated
3. Ensure all required dependencies are installed
4. Review the CSV format if importing data
